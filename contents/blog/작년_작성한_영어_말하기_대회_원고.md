<p>There is one thing that the younger generation is eager to have in Korea: Spec. Spec is a newly-coined word from the abbreviation of specification, meaning the level of education, credit, or accredited English test scores. Until the mid-1990s, undergraduate degree was more than enough for a person's background to find a job. But these days, people have a strong desire for a higher level of education, a better credit, and outstanding English test scores to stand out from the crowd of other people. In order to achieve this, they spend most of their spare time on building up their careers and invest tremendous amount of money to register on the private institutes. What is more surprising is that this trend of chasing after higher specs is influencing not only the middle or high school students, but also the elementary school students. It is frequently announced in the mass media that many students go to excessive number of institutes to get better grades and cut down their hours with their friends just to add one more helping sentence in the report card.</p>
<p>Of course, it is natural for companies or the top-ranked schools to make an academic reference to choose the best talented person. The problem lies on too much emphasis on the person's level of career. As a result, those who do not have outstanding specs are totally excluded no matter how many good talents they may have.</p>
<p>What is behind this situation? Most people would agree that there are two reasons. First, the personnel officers value a person's spec above everything else. Second, applicants are building up even the unnecessary careers to meet the condition. However, higher specs don't mean better talent. Many company executives are saying that newly chosen people lack the required practical skills than before. There is a lesson that we must learn. We must give better credit on the person's personality and other strengths rather than the spec itself. For example, many companies are focusing on the creativity and diligence shown through their camp interviews or internship programs.</p>
<p>A person's personality, talent, and creativity are much more important than one's specs. I truly hope that our society will change into a place where people are judged not by their specs, but by their talents. Thank you.</p></div>
<p>그다지 잘 쓰지는 못한 원고. 작년 영어 말하기 대회에 나갔을 때 작성한 원고인데, 은상을 수상했다. 갑자기 이게 갑툭튀한 이유는 - 올해 영어 말하기 대회 원고를 지금 작성하고 있기 때문이다. 참고하기 위해 작년 원고를 읽는데, 블로그에 한 번 올려보는 것이 좋지 않을까라는 생각이 들었다.</p>
<p>글을 읽으면서 느낀 것은, 작문 실력을 조금 더 늘려야겠다는 것. 사람의 마음에 와닿는 글을 써야 하는데, 잘 안 된다. 읽으면서 감탄이 나오는 글을 써야 하는데, 어떻게 하는 것이 좋으려나. 신문 사설같은 것을 읽으면서 효과적인 글의 구조나 표현 방법에 대해 생각해 봐야겠다는 생각이 들었다. <s>생각이라는 단어가 2번 나오니까 뭔가 문장이 이상한데, 나중에 수정해야 할 듯 하다</s></p>
